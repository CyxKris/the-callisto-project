              The Green Galaxy is a premium blend of high-quality tea leaves sourced from the best tea gardens in China and Japan. This tea is made from unfermented tea leaves that are gently steamed and dried, which helps to preserve the natural antioxidants and other beneficial compounds found in the tea leaves.

              Green tea is a rich source of a particular type of antioxidant called catechins. These compounds help to protect the body against damage caused by free radicals, which can contribute to chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.
